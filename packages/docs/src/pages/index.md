**How do we start?**

The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially.

*The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:*

1. Learn about [Time and Space complexities]()
2. Learn the basics of individual [Data Structures](/structures)
3. Learn the basics of [Algorithms](/algorithms)
4. **Practice** Problems on DSA
