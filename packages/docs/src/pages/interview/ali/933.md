## Problem

You have a RecentCounter class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the RecentCounter class:

- **RecentCounter()** Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
- **int ping(int t)** Adds a new request at time **t**, where **t** represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that has happened in the past **3000** milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range **[t - 3000, t]**.

It is **guaranteed** that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input
['RecentCounter', 'ping', 'ping', 'ping', 'ping']
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

Explanation
RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [<u>1</u>], range is [-2999,1], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [<u>1</u>, <u>100</u>], range is [-2900,100], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [<u>1</u>, <u>100</u>, <u>3001</u>], range is [1,3001], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, <u>100</u>, <u>3001</u>, <u>3002</u>], range is [2,3002], return 3
```

**Constraints:**

- **1 <= t <= 10<sup>9</sup>**
- Each test case will call **ping** with **strictly increasing** values of **t**.
- At most **10<sup>4</sup>** calls will be made to **ping**.

## Solution

```ts
class RecentCounter {
  constructor() {

  }

  ping(t: number): number {

  }
}

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new RecentCounter()
 * var param_1 = obj.ping(t)
 */
```
