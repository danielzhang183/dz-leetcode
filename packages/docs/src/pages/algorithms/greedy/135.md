## Problem

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return `the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>n == ratings.length</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= ratings[i] &lt;= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

```ts
function candy(ratings: number[]): number {

};
```
