## Problem

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return `the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- <code>1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

### Greedy

```txt
ratings: [1, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 2]

forward traversal
Child with a higher rating get more candies than their left child
candy:   [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]

backward traversal
1. Child with a higher rating get more candies than their right child
2. or if already satisfy 1, keep their candies for now
candy:   [1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Implement

```ts
function candy(ratings: number[]): number {
  const len = ratings.length
  const candy: number[] = new Array(len).fill(1)

  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1])
      candy[i] = candy[i - 1] + 1
  }

  for (let i = len - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1])
      candy[i] = Math.max(candy[i], candy[i + 1] + 1)
  }

  return candy.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
}
```

Once traversal, hard to understand

```txt
ratings: [1, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 2]
ans: 1+2+1+2+1+3+4 = 14

|inc|dec|pre|candy|rat|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | +1  | 1 |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | +2  | 2 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | +1  | 2 |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | +2  | 5 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | +1  | 4 |
| 2 | 3 | 1 | +3  | 3 |
| 2 | 4 | 1 | +4  | 2 |
```

Implement

```ts
function candy(ratings: number[]) {
  let candy = 1
  let inc = 1
  let dec = 0
  let pre = 1

  for (let i = 1; i < ratings.length; i++) {
    if (ratings[i] >= ratings[i - 1]) {
      if (ratings[i] === ratings[i - 1])
        pre = 1
      else
        pre++
      candy += pre
      inc = pre
      dec = 0
    }
    else {
      dec++
      if (dec === inc)
        dec++
      candy += dec
      pre = 1
    }
  }

  return candy
}
```
