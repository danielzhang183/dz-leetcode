## Problem

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] &gt;= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,
You need to output 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= g.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>1 &lt;= g[i], s[j] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

## Solution

feed **min** content (as possible) child with **min** cookie (as possible), and vice versa.

```ts
function findContentChildren(g: number[], s: number[]): number {
  g.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  s.sort((a, b) => a - b)
  let j = 0
  let count = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length && j < g.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] >= g[j]) {
      count++
      j++
    }
  }

  return count
}
```
