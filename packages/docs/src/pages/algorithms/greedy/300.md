## Problem

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
output: 4
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
output: 1
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2500</code>
- <code>-10<sup>4</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>


**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?


## Solution

```ts
function lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {

}
```
