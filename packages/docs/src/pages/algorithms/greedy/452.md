## Problem

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [x<sub>start</sub>, x<sub>end</sub>] denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between x<sub>start</sub> and x<sub>end</sub>. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with x<sub>start</sub> and x<sub>end</sub> is **burst** by an arrow shot at x if x<sub>start</sub> &lt;= x &lt;= x<sub>end</sub>. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array points, return `the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= points.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>points[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>-2<sup>31</sup> &lt;= x<sub>start</sub> &lt; x<sub>end</sub> &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

## Solution

```ts
function findMinArrowShots(points: number[][]): number {

}
```
