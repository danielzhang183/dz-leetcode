## Problem

You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>] represents the i<sup>th</sup> person of height h<sub>i</sub> with **exactly** k<sub>i</sub> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to h<sub>i</sub>.

Reconstruct and return `the queue that is represented by the input array`people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>] is the attributes of the j<sup>th</sup> person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= people.length &lt;= 2000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= h<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= k<sub>i</sub> &lt; people.length</code>
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

## Solution

two dimension question that we should `settle down one dimension first`, then consider another dimension after.

1. we should order by **height** in descending order, and keep **higher index** with same height in front
2. arrange people in the queue according to their **index**.

```txt
source [[7, 0], [4, 4], [7, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [5, 2]]
sorted [[7, 0], [7, 1], [6, 1], [5, 0], [5, 2], [4, 4]]

insert [7, 0]: [[7, 0]]
insert [7, 1]: [[7, 0], [7, 1]]
insert [6, 1]: [[7, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1]]
insert [5, 0]: [[5, 0], [7, 0], [6, 1], [7, 1]]
insert [5, 2]: [[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [7, 1]]
insert [4, 4]: [[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [4, 4], [6, 1], [7, 1]]
```

Implement

```ts
function reconstructQueue(people: number[][]): number[][] {
  people.sort((a, b) => (b[0] - a[0]) || (a[1] - b[1]))

  const ans: number[][] = []
  for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++)
    ans.splice(people[i][1], 0, people[i])

  return ans
}
```
