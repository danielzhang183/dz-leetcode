## Problem

You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>] represents the i<sup>th</sup> person of height h<sub>i</sub> with **exactly** k<sub>i</sub> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to h<sub>i</sub>.

Reconstruct and return `the queue that is represented by the input array`people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>] is the attributes of the j<sup>th</sup> person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= people.length &lt;= 2000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= h<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= k<sub>i</sub> &lt; people.length</code>
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

## Solution

```ts
function reconstructQueue(people: number[][]): number[][] {

};
```
