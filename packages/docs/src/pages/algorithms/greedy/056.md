## Problem

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>], merge all overlapping intervals, and return `an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

### Example 2

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= intervals.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>intervals[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= start<sub>i</sub> &lt;= end<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
function merge(intervals: number[][]): number[][] {

};
```
