## Problem

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array&#39;s **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true`if you can reach the last index, or`false`otherwise`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

## Solution

```ts
function canJump(nums: number[]): boolean {

}
```
