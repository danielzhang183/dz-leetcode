## Problem

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return `the **maximum** profit you can achieve`.

 ## Usage

### Example 1

```
**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

### Example 2

```
**Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

### Example 3

```
**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

 
**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {

};
```
