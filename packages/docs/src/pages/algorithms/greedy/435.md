## Problem

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>], return `the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

### Example 2

```
input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

### Example 3

```
input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
output: 0
Explanation: You don&#39;t need to remove any of the intervals since they&#39;re already non-overlapping.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= intervals.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>intervals[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>-5 * 10<sup>4</sup> &lt;= start<sub>i</sub> &lt; end<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: number[][]): number {

}
```
