## Problem

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>], return `the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= intervals.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- <code>-5 *10<sup>4</sup> <= start<sub>i</sub> < end<sub>i</sub> <= 5* 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

### sort by right

```ts
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: number[][]): number {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1])

  let count = 0
  let right = intervals[0][1]
  const len = intervals.length
  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    if (intervals[i][0] >= right) {
      count++
      right = intervals[i][1]
    }
  }

  return len - count - 1
}
```

### sort by left

```ts
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: number[][]): number {
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0])

  let count = 0
  let right = intervals[0][1]
  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const tmp = intervals[i]
    if (tmp[0] >= right) {
      right = tmp[1]
    }
    else {
      right = Math.min(right, tmp[1])
      count++
    }
  }

  return count
}
```
