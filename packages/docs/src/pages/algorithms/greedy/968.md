## Problem

You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return `the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree`.

 ## Usage

### Example 1
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png" style="width: 138px; height: 163px;" />
```
**Input:** root = [0,0,null,0,0]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```

### Example 2
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png" style="width: 139px; height: 312px;" />
```
**Input:** root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```

 
**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.
- <code>Node.val == 0</code>


## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function minCameraCover(root: TreeNode | null): number {

};
```
