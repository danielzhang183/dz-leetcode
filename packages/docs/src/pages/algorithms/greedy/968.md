## Problem

You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return `the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree`.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_01.png" style="width: 138px; height: 163px;" />

```md
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```

### Example 2

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png" style="width: 139px; height: 312px;" />

```md
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `Node.val == 0`

## Solution

### DFS

Camera Status

```ts
enum STATUS {
  WILL_COVER,
  COVER,
  NOT_COVER,
}
```

Implement

```ts
function minCameraCover(root: TreeNode | null): number {
  let count = 0
  const dfs = (root: TreeNode | null) => {
    if (root === null)
      return STATUS.NOT_COVER

    const left = dfs(root.left)
    const right = dfs(root.right)

    if (left === STATUS.NOT_COVER && right === STATUS.NOT_COVER)
      return STATUS.WILL_COVER
    if (left === STATUS.WILL_COVER || right === STATUS.WILL_COVER) {
      count++
      return STATUS.COVER
    }
    if (left === STATUS.COVER || right === STATUS.COVER)
      return STATUS.NOT_COVER
  }

  if (dfs(root) === STATUS.WILL_COVER)
    count++
  return count
}
```
