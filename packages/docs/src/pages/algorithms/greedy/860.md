## Problem

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the i<sup>th</sup> customer pays, return true `if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or` false `otherwise`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: bills = [5,5,5,10,20]
output: true
Explanation:
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: bills = [5,5,10,10,20]
output: false
Explanation:
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= bills.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>bills[i]</code> is either <code>5</code>, <code>10</code>, or <code>20</code>.

## Solution

- consume **$10** takes precedence over **$5**
    - $5 can change $10 (*1)
    - $5 can change $20 (*3)
    - $10 only can change $20

```ts
function lemonadeChange(bills: number[]): boolean {
  let count5 = 0
  let count10 = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
    if (bills[i] === 5) {
      count5++
    }
    else if (bills[i] === 10) {
      if (count5 > 0) {
        count10++
        count5--
      }
      else {
        return false
      }
    }
    else {
      if (count10 > 0 && count5 > 0) {
        count10--
        count5--
      }
      else if (count5 >= 3) {
        count5 -= 3
      }
      else {
        return false
      }
    }
  }

  return true
}
```
