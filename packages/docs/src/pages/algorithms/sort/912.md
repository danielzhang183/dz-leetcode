## Problem

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem **without using any built-in** functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
```

### Example 2

```
input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>-5 * 10<sup>4</sup> &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
function sortArray(nums: number[]): number[] {

}
```
