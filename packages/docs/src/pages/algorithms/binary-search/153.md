## Problem

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

- <code>[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]</code> if it was rotated <code>4</code> times.
- <code>[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]</code> if it was rotated <code>7</code> times.

Notice that **rotating** an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of **unique** elements, return `the minimum element of this array`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>n == nums.length</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5000</code>
- <code>-5000 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 5000</code>
- All the integers of <code>nums</code> are **unique**.
- <code>nums</code> is sorted and rotated between <code>1</code> and <code>n</code> times.

## Solution

### Binary Search

```ts
function findMin(nums: number[]): number {
  let l = 0
  let r = nums.length - 1

  while (l < r) {
    const mid = (l + r) >> 1
    if (nums[r] > nums[mid])
      r = mid
    else
      l = mid + 1
  }

  return nums[l]
}
```
