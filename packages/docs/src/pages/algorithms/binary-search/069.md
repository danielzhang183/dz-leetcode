## Problem

Given a non-negative integer x, return `the square root of`x`rounded down to the nearest integer`. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use <code>pow(x, 0.5)</code> in c++ or <code>x ** 0.5</code> in python.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: x = 4
output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: x = 8
output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>0 &lt;= x &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

## Solution

```ts
function mySqrt(x: number): number {

}
```
