## Problem

Given an integer n, return `true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false`.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3<sup>x</sup>.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: n = 27
output: true
Explanation: 27 = 3<sup>3</sup>
```

### Example 2

```
input: n = 0
output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3<sup>x</sup> = 0.
```

### Example 3

```
input: n = -1
output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3<sup>x</sup> = (-1).
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>-2<sup>31</sup> &lt;= n &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>


**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Solution

```ts
function isPowerOfThree(n: number): boolean {

}
```
