## Problem

Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an **even** number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a **positive** integer number of stones piles[i].

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The **total** number of stones across all the piles is **odd**, so there are no ties.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice starting first**. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the **beginning** or from the **end** of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the **most stones wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true`if Alice wins the game, or`false`if Bob wins`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
output: true
Explanation:
Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Bob takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: piles = [3,7,2,3]
output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>2 &lt;= piles.length &lt;= 500</code>
- <code>piles.length</code> is **even**.
- <code>1 &lt;= piles[i] &lt;= 500</code>
- <code>sum(piles[i])</code> is **odd**.

## Solution

```ts
function stoneGame(piles: number[]): boolean {

}
```
