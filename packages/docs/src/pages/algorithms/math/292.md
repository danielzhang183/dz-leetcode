## Problem

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:

- Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table.
- You and your friend will alternate taking turns, and **you go first**.
- On each turn, the person whose turn it is will remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap.
- The one who removes the last stone is the winner.

Given n, the number of stones in the heap, return true` if you can win the game assuming both you and your friend play optimally, otherwise return `false.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: n = 4
output: false
Explanation: These are the possible outcomes:
1. You remove 1 stone. Your friend removes 3 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
2. You remove 2 stones. Your friend removes 2 stones, including the last stone. Your friend wins.
3. You remove 3 stones. Your friend removes the last stone. Your friend wins.
In all outcomes, your friend wins.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: n = 1
output: true
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: n = 2
output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

## Solution

```ts
function canWinNim(n: number): boolean {

}
```
