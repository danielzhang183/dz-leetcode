## Problem

You are given an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of 1&#39;s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1&#39;s you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return `the array after sorting it`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
**Explantion:** [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
**Explantion:** All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 500</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
function sortByBits(arr: number[]): number[] {

};
```
