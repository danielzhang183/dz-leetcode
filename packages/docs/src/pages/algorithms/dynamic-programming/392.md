## Problem

Given two strings s and t, return true`if`s`is a **subsequence** of`t`, or`false`otherwise`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., 'ace' is a subsequence of '<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>' while 'aec' is not).

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
output: true
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- <code>0 <= t.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>k</sub> where k >= 10<sup>9</sup>, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution

### Traversal

```ts
function isSubsequence(s: string, t: string): boolean {
  const [n1, n2] = [s.length, t.length]
  let [i, j] = [0, 0]
  while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
    while (j < n2 && s[i] !== t[j])
      j++
    i++
  }

  return i === n1
}
```

### DP

```ts
function isSubsequence(s: string, t: string): boolean {
  const [m, n] = [s.length, t.length]
  const dp: number[][] = Array.from(
    { length: m + 1 },
    () => new Array(n + 1).fill(0),
  )
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (s[i - 1] === t[j - 1])
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
      else
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    }
  }

  return dp[m][n] === m
}
```
