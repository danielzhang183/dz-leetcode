## Problem

Given two strings s and t, return true`if`s`is a **subsequence** of`t`, or`false`otherwise`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., 'ace' is a subsequence of '<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>' while 'aec' is not).

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
output: true
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= t.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> consist only of lowercase English letters.

**Follow up:** Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>k</sub> where k &gt;= 10<sup>9</sup>, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution

```ts
function isSubsequence(s: string, t: string): boolean {

}
```
