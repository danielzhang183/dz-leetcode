## Problem

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return `the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction`. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

### Greedy

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  let min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
  let max = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    min = Math.min(min, prices[i])
    max = Math.max(prices[i] - min, max)
  }

  return max
}
```

### DP

- `dp[i]` represents i<sup>th</sup> day transaction siutation
- <code>dp[i][0]` represents i<sup>th</sup> day buy at `min cost</code>
- <code>dp[i][1]` represents i<sup>th</sup> day sell at `max profit</code>

```txt
initial:
  dp[0][0] = -prices[0]
  dp[0][1] = 0

equation:
  dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i   1][0], -prices[i])
  dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], prices[i] + dp[i - 1][0])

dp changes:
  prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
  [[ -7, 0 ], [ -1, 0 ], [ -1, 4 ], [ -1, 4 ], [ -1, 5 ], [ -1, 5 ]]
```

Implement

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  const len = prices.length
  const dp: number[][] = [[-prices[0], 0]]
  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    dp[i] = []
    dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], -prices[i])
    dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], prices[i] + dp[i - 1][0])
  }

  return dp[len - 1][1]
}
```
