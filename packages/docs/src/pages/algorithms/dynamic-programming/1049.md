## Problem

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the i<sup>th</sup> stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x &lt;= y. The result of this smash is:

- If <code>x == y</code>, both stones are destroyed, and
- If <code>x != y</code>, the stone of weight <code>x</code> is destroyed, and the stone of weight <code>y</code> has new weight <code>y - x</code>.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return `the smallest possible weight of the left stone`. If there are no stones left, return 0.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 30</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= stones[i] &lt;= 100</code>

## Solution

```ts
function lastStoneWeightII(stones: number[]): number {

}
```
