## Problem

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the i<sup>th</sup> stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x &lt;= y. The result of this smash is:

- If <code>x == y</code>, both stones are destroyed, and
- If <code>x != y</code>, the stone of weight <code>x</code> is destroyed, and the stone of weight <code>y</code> has new weight <code>y - x</code>.

At the end of the game, there is **at most one** stone left.

Return `the smallest possible weight of the left stone`. If there are no stones left, return 0.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 30</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= stones[i] &lt;= 100</code>

## Solution

### DP

have the same thought as [416. Partition Equal Subset Sum](/algorithms/dynamic-programming/416)

- Divide the pile of stones into two piles of as equal a weight as possible
- think half of total stone weight as **pack capacity**
- think stone weight as stone **value** too

one dimession array

```ts
function lastStoneWeightII(stones: number[]): number {
  const len = stones.length
  const sum = stones.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
  const target = sum >> 1
  const dp = Array.from(
    { length: len },
    () => Array.from({ length: target + 1 }).fill(0),
  ) as number[][]

  for (let i = stones[0]; i <= target; i++)
    dp[0][i] = stones[0]

  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = j < stones[i]
        ? dp[i - 1][j]
        : Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - stones[i]] + stones[i])
    }
  }

  return sum - 2 * dp[len - 1][target]
}
```

two dimessions array

```ts
function lastStoneWeightII(stones: number[]): number {
  const sum = stones.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
  const target = sum >> 1
  const dp: number[] = new Array(target + 1).fill(0)

  for (const stone of stones) {
    for (let j = target; j >= stone; j--)
      dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[j - stone] + stone)
  }

  return sum - 2 * dp[target]
}
```
