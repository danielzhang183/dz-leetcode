## Problem

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return `the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`

## Solution

### DP

```ts
function rob(nums: number[]): number {
  const n = nums.length
  if (n === 1)
    return nums[0]
  if (n === 2)
    return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])
  const dp: number[] = [nums[0], Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])]
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++)
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2])

  return dp[n - 1]
}
```

### scroll array

```ts
function rob(nums: number[]): number {
  const n = nums.length
  if (n === 1)
    return nums[0]
  if (n === 2)
    return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])
  let first = nums[0]
  let second = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    const tmp = second
    second = Math.max(first + nums[i], second)
    first = tmp
  }

  return second
}
```
