## Problem

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and <b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night</b>.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return `the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight <b>without alerting the police</b>`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

### Example 2

```
input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 400</code>


## Solution

```ts
function rob(nums: number[]): number {

}
```
