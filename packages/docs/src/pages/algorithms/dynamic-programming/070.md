## Problem

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`

## Solution

### DFS

```ts
export function climbStairs1(n: number): number {
  if (n < 3)
    return n

  return climbStairs(n - 1) + climbStairs(n - 2)
}
```

### DP

```txt
inital: dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2
equation: dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
```

```ts
export function climbStairs2(n: number): number {
  const dp: number[] = [0, 1, 2]
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++)
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]

  return dp[n]
}
```

### scroll array

```ts
export function climbStairs(n: number): number {
  if (n < 3)
    return n

  let p = 0
  let q = 1
  let t = 2

  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    p = q + t
    q = t
    t = p
  }

  return p
}
```
