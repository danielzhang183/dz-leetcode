## Problem

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of i<sup>th</sup> step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return `the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: cost = [10,<u>15</u>,20]
output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

### Example 2

```
input: cost = [<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>,1,<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>,<u>1</u>,100,<u>1</u>]
output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>2 &lt;= cost.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= cost[i] &lt;= 999</code>


## Solution

```ts
function minCostClimbingStairs(cost: number[]): number {

}
```
