## Problem

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of i<sup>th</sup> step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Return `the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
  - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
  - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
  - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
  - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
  - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
  - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
  - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## Solution

### DP

```txt
initial:  dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 0
equation: dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i], dp[i - 2] + const[i - 2])

[1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1], dp changes:
  1: [ 0, 0, 1 ]
  1: [ 0, 0, 1, 2 ]
  1: [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2 ]
100: [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3 ]
  1: [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
  1: [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
100: [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]
  1: [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]
end: [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6]
```

Implement

```ts
function minCostClimbingStairs(cost: number[]): number {
  const dp: number[] = [0, 0]
  for (let i = 2; i <= cost.length; i++)
    dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2])

  return dp.pop()!
}
```

### scroll array

```ts
function minCostClimbingStairs(cost: number[]): number {
  let p = 0
  let q = 0

  for (let i = 2; i <= cost.length; i++) {
    const tmp = Math.min(p + cost[i - 2], q + cost[i - 1])
    p = q
    q = tmp
  }

  return q
}
```
