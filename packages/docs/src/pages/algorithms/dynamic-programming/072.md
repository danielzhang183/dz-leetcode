## Problem

Given two strings word1 and word2, return `the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: word1 = 'horse', word2 = 'ros'
output: 3
Explanation:
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: word1 = 'intention', word2 = 'execution'
output: 5
Explanation:
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>0 &lt;= word1.length, word2.length &lt;= 500</code>
- <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code> consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```ts
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {

}
```
