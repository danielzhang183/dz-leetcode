## Problem

Given two strings word1 and word2, return `the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: word1 = 'horse', word2 = 'ros'
output: 3
Explanation:
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: word1 = 'intention', word2 = 'execution'
output: 5
Explanation:
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### DP

```ts
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {
  const [m, n] = [word1.length, word2.length]
  const dp: number[][] = Array.from(
    { length: m + 1 },
    () => new Array(n + 1).fill(0),
  )
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++)
    dp[i][0] = i
  for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++)
    dp[0][j] = j

  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
      }
      else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.min(
          Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]),
          dp[i - 1][j - 1],
        ) + 1
      }
    }
  }

  return dp[m][n]
}
```
