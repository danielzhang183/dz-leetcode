## Problem

Given two strings word1 and word2, return `the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: word1 = 'horse', word2 = 'ros'
output: 3
Explanation:
horse -&gt; rorse (replace &#39;h&#39; with &#39;r&#39;)
rorse -&gt; rose (remove &#39;r&#39;)
rose -&gt; ros (remove &#39;e&#39;)
```

### Example 2

```
input: word1 = 'intention', word2 = 'execution'
output: 5
Explanation:
intention -&gt; inention (remove &#39;t&#39;)
inention -&gt; enention (replace &#39;i&#39; with &#39;e&#39;)
enention -&gt; exention (replace &#39;n&#39; with &#39;x&#39;)
exention -&gt; exection (replace &#39;n&#39; with &#39;c&#39;)
exection -&gt; execution (insert &#39;u&#39;)
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>0 &lt;= word1.length, word2.length &lt;= 500</code>
- <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code> consist of lowercase English letters.


## Solution

```ts
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {

}
```
