## Problem

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Usage

### Example 1

```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

### Example 2

```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>1 &lt;= prices[i] &lt; 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= fee &lt; 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[], fee: number): number {

};
```
