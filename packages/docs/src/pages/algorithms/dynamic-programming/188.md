## Problem

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 100</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 1000</code>

## Solution

```ts
function maxProfit(k: number, prices: number[]): number {

};
```
