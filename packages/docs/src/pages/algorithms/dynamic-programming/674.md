## Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return `the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray)`. The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

## Solution

```ts
function findLengthOfLCIS(nums: number[]): number {

}
```
