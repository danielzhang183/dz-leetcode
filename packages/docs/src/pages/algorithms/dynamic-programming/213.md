## Problem

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return `the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

### DP

```ts
function rob(nums: number[]): number {
  const n = nums.length
  if (n === 1)
    return nums[0]
  if (n === 2)
    return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])

  const helper = (start: number, end: number) => {
    const dp: number[] = []
    dp[start] = nums[start]
    dp[start + 1] = Math.max(nums[start], nums[start + 1])
    for (let i = start + 2; i < end; i++)
      dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], nums[i] + dp[i - 2])
    return dp[dp.length - 1]
  }

  return Math.max(helper(0, n - 1), helper(1, n))
}
```

### scroll array

```ts
function rob(nums: number[]): number {
  const n = nums.length
  if (n === 1)
    return nums[0]
  if (n === 2)
    return Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])

  const helper = (start: number, end: number) => {
    let first = nums[start]
    let second = Math.max(nums[start], nums[start + 1])
    for (let i = start + 2; i < end; i++) {
      const tmp = second
      second = Math.max(second, first + nums[i])
      first = tmp
    }

    return second
  }

  return Math.max(helper(0, n - 1), helper(1, n))
}
```
