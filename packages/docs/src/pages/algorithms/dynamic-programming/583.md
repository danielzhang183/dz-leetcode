## Problem

Given two strings word1 and word2, return `the minimum number of **steps** required to make` word1 `and` word2 `the same`.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: word1 = 'sea', word2 = 'eat'
output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make 'sea' to 'ea' and another step to make 'eat' to 'ea'.
```

### Example 2

```
input: word1 = 'leetcode', word2 = 'etco'
output: 4
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= word1.length, word2.length &lt;= 500</code>
- <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code> consist of only lowercase English letters.


## Solution

```ts
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {

}
```
