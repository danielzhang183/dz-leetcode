## Problem

Given two strings word1 and word2, return `the minimum number of **steps** required to make` word1 `and` word2 `the same`.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: word1 = 'sea', word2 = 'eat'
output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make 'sea' to 'ea' and another step to make 'eat' to 'ea'.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: word1 = 'leetcode', word2 = 'etco'
output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Longest Common Sequence

[1143. Longest Common Subsequence](/algorithms/dynamic-programming/1143)

```ts
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {
  const [m, n] = [word1.length, word2.length]
  const dp: number[][] = Array.from(
    { length: m + 1 },
    () => Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => 0),
  )
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1])
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
      else
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    }
  }

  return m + n - 2 * dp[m][n]
}
```

### DP

```txt
word1: leetcode
word2: etco

dp changes:
       e, t, c, o
  [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
l [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
e [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
e [ 3, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
t [ 4, 3, 2, 3, 4 ]
c [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 3 ]
o [ 6, 5, 4, 3, 4 ]
d [ 7, 6, 5, 4, 5 ]
e [ 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 ]
```

Implement

```ts
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {
  const [m, n] = [word1.length, word2.length]
  const dp: number[][] = Array.from(
    { length: m + 1 },
    () => new Array(n + 1).fill(0),
  )
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++)
    dp[i][0] = i
  for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++)
    dp[0][j] = j

  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (word1[i] === word2[j])
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
      else
        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1
    }
  }

  return dp[m][n]
}
```
