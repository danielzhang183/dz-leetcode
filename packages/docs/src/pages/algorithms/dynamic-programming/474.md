## Problem

You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.

Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are **at most** `m` `0`'s and `n` `1`'s in the subset`.

A set x is a **subset** of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: strs = ['10','0001','111001','1','0'], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {'10', '0001', '1', '0'}, so the answer is 4.
Other valid but smaller subsets include {'0001', '1'} and {'10', '1', '0'}.
{'111001'} is an invalid subset because it contains 4 1's, greater than the maximum of 3.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: strs = ['10','0','1'], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
**Explanation:** The largest subset is {'0', '1'}, so the answer is 2.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= strs.length &lt;= 600</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= strs[i].length &lt;= 100</code>
- <code>strs[i]</code> consists only of digits <code>'0'</code> and <code>'1'</code>.
- <code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 100</code>

## Solution

```ts
function findMaxForm(strs: string[], m: number, n: number): number {

}
```
