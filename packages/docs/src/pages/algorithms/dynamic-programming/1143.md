## Problem

Given two strings text1 and text2, return `the length of their longest **common subsequence**.`If there is no **common subsequence**, return 0.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, <code>'ace'</code> is a subsequence of <code>'abcde'</code>.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: text1 = 'abcde', text2 = 'ace'
output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is 'ace' and its length is 3.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: text1 = 'abc', text2 = 'abc'
output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is 'abc' and its length is 3.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: text1 = 'abc', text2 = 'def'
output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= text1.length, text2.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>text1</code> and <code>text2</code> consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Solution

```txt
text1: 'abcde'
text2: 'ace'

dp changes:
    a c e
  0 0 0 0
a 0 1 1 1
b 0 1 1 1
c 0 1 2 2
d 0 1 2 2
e 0 1 2 3
```

Implement

```ts
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1: string, text2: string): number {
  const [m, n] = [text1.length, text2.length]
  const dp: number[][] = Array.from(
    { length: m + 1 },
    () => Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => 0),
  )
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1])
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
      else
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    }
  }

  return dp[m][n]
}
```
