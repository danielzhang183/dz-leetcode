## Problem

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return `the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner`.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg" style="width: 242px; height: 242px;" />

```md
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -&gt; Right -&gt; Down -&gt; Down
2. Down -&gt; Down -&gt; Right -&gt; Right
```

### Example 2

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg" style="width: 162px; height: 162px;" />

```md
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>m == obstacleGrid.length</code>
- <code>n == obstacleGrid[i].length</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 100</code>
- <code>obstacleGrid[i][j]</code> is <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.

## Solution

```ts
function uniquePathsWithObstacles(obstacleGrid: number[][]): number {

}
```
