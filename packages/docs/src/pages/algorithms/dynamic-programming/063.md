## Problem

You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include **any** square that is an obstacle.

Return `the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner`.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg" style="width: 242px; height: 242px;" />

```md
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

### Example 2

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot2.jpg" style="width: 162px; height: 162px;" />

```md
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == obstacleGrid.length`
- `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `obstacleGrid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution

### DP

```txt
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0

dp:
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 2

initial:  dp[i][0] = 1, dp[0][i] = 1
equation: dp[m][n] = dp[m - 1][n] + dp[m][n - 1]
```

Implement

```ts
function uniquePathsWithObstacles(obstacleGrid: number[][]): number {
  const m = obstacleGrid.length
  const n = obstacleGrid[0].length
  const dp = Array.from(
    { length: m },
    () => Array.from({ length: n }).fill(0),
  ) as number[][]
  for (let i = 0; i < m && obstacleGrid[i][0] === 0; i++)
    dp[i][0] = 1
  for (let j = 0; j < n && obstacleGrid[0][j] === 0; j++)
    dp[0][j] = 1

  for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (obstacleGrid[i][j])
        continue
      dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
    }
  }

  return dp[m - 1][n - 1]
}
```
