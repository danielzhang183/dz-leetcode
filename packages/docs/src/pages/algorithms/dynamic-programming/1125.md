## Problem

In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people. The i<sup>th</sup> person people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has.

Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the index of each person.

- For example, <code>team = [0, 1, 3]</code> represents the people with skills <code>people[0]</code>, <code>people[1]</code>, and <code>people[3]</code>.

Return `any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of each person`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

It is **guaranteed** an answer exists.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: 
req_skills = ["java","nodejs","reactjs"], 
people = [
  ["java"],
  ["nodejs"],
  ["nodejs","reactjs"],
]
Output: [0,2]
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: 
req_skills = ["algorithms","math","java","reactjs","csharp","aws"],
people = [
  ["algorithms","math","java"],["algorithms","math","reactjs"],
  ["java","csharp","aws"],
  ["reactjs","csharp"],
  ["csharp","math"],
  ["aws","java"],
]
Output: [1,2]
```
 
**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= req_skills.length &lt;= 16</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= req_skills[i].length &lt;= 16</code>
- <code>req_skills[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of <code>req_skills</code> are **unique**.
- <code>1 &lt;= people.length &lt;= 60</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= people[i].length &lt;= 16</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= people[i][j].length &lt;= 16</code>
- <code>people[i][j]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of <code>people[i]</code> are **unique**.
- Every skill in <code>people[i]</code> is a skill in <code>req_skills</code>.
- It is guaranteed a sufficient team exists.


## Solution

```ts
function smallestSufficientTeam(req_skills: string[], people: string[][]): number[] {

}
```
