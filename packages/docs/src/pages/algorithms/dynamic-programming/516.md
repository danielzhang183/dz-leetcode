## Problem

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: s = 'bbbab'
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is 'bbbb'.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: s = 'cbbd'
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is 'bb'.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```ts
function longestPalindromeSubseq(s: string): number {

}
```
