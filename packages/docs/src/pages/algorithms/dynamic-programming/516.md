## Problem

Given a string s, find `the longest palindromic **subsequence**&#39;s length in` s.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
**Input:** s = &quot;bbbab&quot;
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is &quot;bbbb&quot;.
```

### Example 2

```md
**Input:** s = &quot;cbbd&quot;
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** One possible longest palindromic subsequence is &quot;bb&quot;.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>s</code> consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```ts
function longestPalindromeSubseq(s: string): number {

};
```
