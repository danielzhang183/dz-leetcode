## Problem

Given two strings s and t, return `the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t`.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., 'ACE' is a subsequence of 'ABCDE' while 'AEC' is not).

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: s = 'rabbbit', t = 'rabbit'
output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate 'rabbit' from s.
**<u>rabb</u>**b**<u>it</u>**
**<u>ra</u>**b**<u>bbit</u>**
**<u>rab</u>**b**<u>bit</u>**
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: s = 'babgbag', t = 'bag'
output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate 'bag' from s.
**<u>ba</u>**b<u>**g**</u>bag
**<u>ba</u>**bgba**<u>g</u>**
<u>**b**</u>abgb**<u>ag</u>**
ba<u>**b**</u>gb<u>**ag**</u>
babg**<u>bag</u>**```


**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.


## Solution

```ts
function numDistinct(s: string, t: string): number {

}
```
