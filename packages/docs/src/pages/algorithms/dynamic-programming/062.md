## Problem

There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return `the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png" style="width: 400px; height: 183px;" />

```md
Input: m = 3, n = 7
output: 28
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: m = 3, n = 2
output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -&gt; Down -&gt; Down
2. Down -&gt; Down -&gt; Right
3. Down -&gt; Right -&gt; Down
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 100</code>

## Solution

```ts
function uniquePaths(m: number, n: number): number {

}
```
