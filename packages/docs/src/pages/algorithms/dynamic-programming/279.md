## Problem

Given an integer n, return `the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to` n.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

```ts
function numSquares(n: number): number {

};
```
