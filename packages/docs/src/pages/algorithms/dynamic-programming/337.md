## Problem

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the root of the binary tree, return `the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**`.

## Usage

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob1-tree.jpg" style="width: 277px; height: 293px;" />

```
input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

### Example 2
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg" style="width: 357px; height: 293px;" />
```
input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```


**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function rob(root: TreeNode | null): number {

}
```
