## Problem

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return `the **maximum** profit you can achieve`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

### DP

```txt
initial:
  dp[0][0] = -prices[0]
  dp[0][1] = 0
equation:
  dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i])
  dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i])

dp changes:
[ -7, 0 ]
[ -1, 0 ]
[ -1, 4 ]
[  1, 4 ]
[  1, 7 ]
[  3, 7 ]
```

Implement

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  const dp: number[][] = [[-prices[0], 0]]
  const len = prices.length
  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    dp[i] = []
    dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] - prices[i])
    dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i])
  }

  return dp[len - 1][1]
}
```

### Greedy

see more [detail](/algorithms/greedy/122)

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  let profit = 0
  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])
      profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
  }

  return profit
}
```
