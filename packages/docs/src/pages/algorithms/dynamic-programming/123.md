## Problem

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

## Solution

### DP

```txt
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dp changes:

     b1 s1  b2 s2
[ 0, -1, 0, -1, 0 ]
[ 0, -1, 1, -1, 1 ]
[ 0, -1, 2, -1, 2 ]
[ 0, -1, 3, -1, 3 ]
[ 0, -1, 4, -1, 4 ]
```

two dimensions array

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  const dp: number[][] = [[0, -prices[0], 0, -prices[0], 0]]
  const len = prices.length

  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    dp[i] = [0]
    dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], -prices[i])
    dp[i][2] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][2], dp[i - 1][1] + prices[i])
    dp[i][3] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][3], dp[i - 1][2] - prices[i])
    dp[i][4] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][4], dp[i - 1][3] + prices[i])
  }

  return dp[len - 1][4]
}
```

scroll array

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  const dp: number[] = [0, -prices[0], 0, -prices[0], 0]
  const len = prices.length

  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    dp[1] = Math.max(dp[1], dp[0] - prices[i])
    dp[2] = Math.max(dp[2], dp[1] + prices[i])
    dp[3] = Math.max(dp[3], dp[2] - prices[i])
    dp[4] = Math.max(dp[4], dp[3] + prices[i])
  }

  return dp[4]
}
```
