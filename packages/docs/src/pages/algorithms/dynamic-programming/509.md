## Problem

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n &gt; 1.
```

Given n, calculate F(n).

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: n = 2
output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: n = 3
output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: n = 4
output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>0 &lt;= n &lt;= 30</code>


## Solution

```ts
function fib(n: number): number {

}
```
