## Problem

You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return `the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount`. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= coins.length &lt;= 12</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= coins[i] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= amount &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>

## Solution

```ts
function coinChange(coins: number[], amount: number): number {

};
```
