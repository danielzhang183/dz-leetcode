## Problem

Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

- Only numbers <code>1</code> through <code>9</code> are used.
- Each number is used **at most once**.

Return `a list of all possible valid combinations`. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.```

### Example 2

```md
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: k = 4, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 &gt; 1, there are no valid combination.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>2 &lt;= k &lt;= 9</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 60</code>

## Solution

```ts
function combinationSum3(k: number, n: number): number[][] {

};
```
