## Problem

Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

- Only numbers `1` through `9` are used.
- Each number is used **at most once**.

Return `a list of all possible valid combinations`. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: k = 4, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= k <= 9`
- `1 <= n <= 60`

## Solution

share the same thought with [77. Combinations](/algorithms/back-tracking/077)

```ts
function combinationSum3(k: number, n: number): number[][] {
  const ans: number[][] = []
  const path: number[] = []
  let sum = 0

  const dfs = (begin: number) => {
    if (sum > n)
      return
    if (path.length === k) {
      sum === n && ans.push([...path])
      return
    }
    for (let i = begin; i <= 9 - (k - path.length) + 1; i++) {
      path.push(i)
      sum += i
      dfs(i + 1)
      sum -= i
      path.pop()
    }
  }

  dfs(1)
  return ans
}
```
