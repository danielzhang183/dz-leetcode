## Problem

Given two integers n and k, return `all possible combinations of` k `numbers chosen from the range` [1, n].

You may return the answer in **any order**.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: n = 4, k = 2
output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
```

### Example 2

```
input: n = 1, k = 1
output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= n</code>


## Solution

```ts
function combine(n: number, k: number): number[][] {

}
```
