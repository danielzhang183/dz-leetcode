## Problem

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>] indicates that there is an edge between nodes a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub> in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

## Usage

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-1-graph.jpg" style="width: 222px; height: 222px;" />

```md
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

### Example 2

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/reduntant1-2-graph.jpg" style="width: 382px; height: 222px;" />

```md
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>n == edges.length</code>
- <code>3 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>edges[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub> &lt; b<sub>i</sub> &lt;= edges.length</code>
- <code>a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub></code>
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.

## Solution

```ts
function findRedundantConnection(edges: number[][]): number[] {

};
```
