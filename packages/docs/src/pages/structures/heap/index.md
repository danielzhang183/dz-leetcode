*In General, heaps are of two types:*

**Max Heap**

In this heap, the value of the root node must be the `greatest` among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left and right sub-tree also.

**Min Heap**

In this heap, the value of the root node must be the `smallest` among all its child nodes and the same thing must be done for its left ans right sub-tree also.
