## Problem

## Examples

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor" target="_blank">definition of LCA on Wikipedia</a>: &ldquo;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).&rdquo;

**Example 1:**
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png" style="width: 200px; height: 190px;" />

```md
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png" style="width: 200px; height: 190px;" />

```md
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```md
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[2, 10<sup>5</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.

## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function lowestCommonAncestor(root: TreeNode | null, p: TreeNode | null, q: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {

}
```
