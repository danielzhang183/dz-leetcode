## Problem

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return `all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)" target="_blank">mode(s)</a> (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it`.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in **any order**.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node&#39;s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node&#39;s key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Usage

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/11/mode-tree.jpg" style="width: 142px; height: 222px;" />
```md
**Input:** root = [1,null,2,2]
**Output:** [2]
```

### Example 2

```md
**Input:** root = [0]
**Output:** [0]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-10<sup>5</sup> &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function findMode(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {

};
```
