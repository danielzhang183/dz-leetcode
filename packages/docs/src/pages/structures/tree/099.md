## Problem

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. `Recover the tree without changing its structure`.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg" style="width: 422px; height: 302px;" />

```md
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

### Example 2

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg" style="width: 581px; height: 302px;" />

```md
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- <code>-2<sup>31</sup> <= Node.val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

**Follow up:** A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant O(1) space solution?

## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

/**
 Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
 */
function recoverTree(root: TreeNode | null): void {

}
```
