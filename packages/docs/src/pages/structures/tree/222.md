## Problem

Given the root of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2<sup>h</sup> nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg" style="width: 372px; height: 302px;" />

```md
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
output: 6
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: root = []
output: 0
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: root = [1]
output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function countNodes(root: TreeNode | null): number {

}
```
