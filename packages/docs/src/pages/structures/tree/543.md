## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return `the length of the **diameter** of the tree`.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg" style="width: 292px; height: 302px;" />

```md
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: root = [1,2]
output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-100 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 100</code>

## Solution

### DFS

```ts
function diameterOfBinaryTree(root: TreeNode | null): number {
  let max = 0
  const depth = (root: TreeNode | null): number => {
    if (root == null)
      return 0

    const left = depth(root.left)
    const right = depth(root.right)
    max = Math.max(max, left + right)
    return Math.max(left, right) + 1
  }

  depth(root)
  return max
}
```
