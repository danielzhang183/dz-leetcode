## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return `the length of the **diameter** of the tree`.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Usage

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg" style="width: 292px; height: 302px;" />

```
input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

### Example 2

```
input: root = [1,2]
output: 1
```


**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-100 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 100</code>


## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function diameterOfBinaryTree(root: TreeNode | null): number {

}
```
