## Problem

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a `binary search tree` is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Examples

### Example 1

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/02/tree.png" style="width: 500px; height: 341px;" />

```md
**Input:** root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
**Output:** [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

### Example 2

```md
**Input:** root = [0,null,1]
**Output:** [1,null,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- <code>-10<sup>4</sup> &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- All the values in the tree are **unique**.
- <code>root</code> is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.

**Note:** This question is the same as 1038: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/" target="_blank">https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/</a>

## Solution

```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function convertBST(root: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {

};
```
