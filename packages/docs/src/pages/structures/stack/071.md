## Problem

Given a string path, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash &#39;/&#39;) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period &#39;.&#39; refers to the current directory, a double period &#39;..&#39; refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. &#39;//&#39;) are treated as a single slash &#39;/&#39;. For this problem, any other format of periods such as &#39;...&#39; are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

- The path starts with a single slash <code>&#39;/&#39;</code>.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash <code>&#39;/&#39;</code>.
- The path does not end with a trailing <code>&#39;/&#39;</code>.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period <code>&#39;.&#39;</code> or double period <code>&#39;..&#39;</code>)

Return `the simplified **canonical path**`.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: path = '/home/'
output: '/home'
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

### Example 2

```
input: path = '/../'
output: '/'
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

### Example 3

```
input: path = '/home//foo/'
output: '/home/foo'
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= path.length &lt;= 3000</code>
- <code>path</code> consists of English letters, digits, period <code>&#39;.&#39;</code>, slash <code>&#39;/&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;_&#39;</code>.
- <code>path</code> is a valid absolute Unix path.


## Solution

```ts
function simplifyPath(path: string): string {
  const stack: string[] = []

  for (const p of path.split('/')) {
    if (['', '.'].includes(p))
      continue
    else if (p === '..')
      stack.pop()
    else
      stack.push(p)
  }

  return `/${stack.join('/')}`
}
```
