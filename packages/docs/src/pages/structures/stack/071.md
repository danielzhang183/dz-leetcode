## Problem

Given a string path, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The **canonical path** should have the following format:

- The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
- The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Return `the simplified **canonical path**`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: path = '/home/'
output: '/home'
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: path = '/../'
output: '/'
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: path = '/home//foo/'
output: '/home/foo'
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 3000`
- `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
- `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.

## Solution

```ts
function simplifyPath(path: string): string {
  const stack: string[] = []

  for (const p of path.split('/')) {
    if (['', '.'].includes(p))
      continue
    else if (p === '..')
      stack.pop()
    else
      stack.push(p)
  }

  return `/${stack.join('/')}`
}
```
