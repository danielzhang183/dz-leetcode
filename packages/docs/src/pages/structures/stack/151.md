## Problem

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return `a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.`

**Note** that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: s = 'the sky is blue'
output: 'blue is sky the'
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: s = '  hello world  '
output: 'world hello'
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: s = 'a good   example'
output: 'example good a'
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is **at least one** word in `s`.

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?

## Solution

```ts
function reverseWords(s: string): string {
  return s.split(' ').filter(i => i).reverse().join(' ')
}
```
