## Problem

Given two strings s and t, `determine if they are isomorphic`.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>t.length == s.length</code>
- <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> consist of any valid ascii character.

## Solution

```ts
function isIsomorphic(s: string, t: string): boolean {

}
```
