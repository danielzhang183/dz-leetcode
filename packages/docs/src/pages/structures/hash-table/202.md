## Problem

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return true `if` n `is a happy number, and` false `if not`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82
8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68
6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100
1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

## Solution

```ts
function isHappy(n: number): boolean {

}
```
