Different from `Array`, it is `not` allocated to contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node of the linked list is allocated to some random memory space and the previous node maintains a pointer that points to this node.

So no direct memory access of any node is possible and it is also `dynamic`, the size of the linked list can be adjusted at any time.
