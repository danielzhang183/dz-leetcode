## Problem

The **next greater element** of some element x in an array is the **first greater** element that is **to the right** of x in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed** integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 &lt;= i &lt; nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the **next greater element** of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return `an array`ans`of length`nums1.length`such that`ans[i]`is the **next greater element** as described above.`

## Usage

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,<u>4</u>,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [<u>1</u>,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,<u>2</u>]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,<u>2</u>,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,<u>4</u>]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= nums1.length &lt;= nums2.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= nums1[i], nums2[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- All integers in <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> are **unique**.
- All the integers of <code>nums1</code> also appear in <code>nums2</code>.

**Follow up:** Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?

## Solution

```ts
function nextGreaterElement(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number[] {

};
```
