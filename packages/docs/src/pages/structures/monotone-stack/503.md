## Problem

Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return `the **next greater number** for every element in` nums.

The **next greater number** of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
The number 2 can't find next greater number.
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

## Solution

### loop array

```ts
function nextGreaterElements(nums: number[]): number[] {
  const n: number = nums.length
  const stack: number[] = []
  const ans: number[] = new Array(n).fill(-1)

  for (let i = 0; i < n * 2 - 1; i++) {
    const index = i % n
    let top = stack[stack.length - 1]
    while (stack.length && nums[top] < nums[index]) {
      ans[top] = nums[index]
      stack.pop()
      top = stack[stack.length - 1]
    }
    if (i < n)
      stack.push(i)
  }
  return ans
}
```
