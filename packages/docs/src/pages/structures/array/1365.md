## Problem

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i **and** nums[j] &lt; nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation:
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>2 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 500</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 100</code>

## Solution

```ts
function smallerNumbersThanCurrent(nums: number[]): number[] {

}
```
