## Problem

Given an integer array nums sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">**in-place**</a> such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a>** with O(1) extra memory.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```java
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

## Usage

### Example 1

```
input: nums = [1,1,2]
output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

### Example 2

```
input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```


**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>-100 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 100</code>
- <code>nums</code> is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.


## Solution

```ts
// two-pointers
function removeDuplicates(nums: number[]): number {
  const len = nums.length
  if (len === 1)
    return 1

  let j = 1
  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== nums[j - 1])
      nums[j++] = nums[i]
  }

  return j
}

// array apis
function removeDuplicates(nums: number[]): number {
  const newArray = [...new Set(nums)]
  nums.splice(0, newArray.length, ...newArray)
  return newArray.length
}
```
