## Problem

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>-2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
- <code>0 <= k <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?

## Solution

```ts
/**
 Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
 */
function rotate(nums: number[], k: number): void {

}
```
