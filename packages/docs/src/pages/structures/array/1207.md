## Problem

Given an array of integers arr, return true `if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is **unique** or`false`otherwise`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.```

### Example 2

```md
Input: arr = [1,2]
Output: false
```

### Example 3

```md
Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```ts
function uniqueOccurrences(arr: number[]): boolean {

}
```
