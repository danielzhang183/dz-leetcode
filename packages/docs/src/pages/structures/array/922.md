## Problem

Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are **odd**, and the other half are **even**.

Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is **odd**, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is **even**.

Return `any answer array that satisfies this condition`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: nums = [2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `nums.length` is even.
- Half of the integers in `nums` are even.
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

**Follow Up:** Could you solve it in-place?

## Solution

### Two Pointers

```ts
function sortArrayByParityII(nums: number[]): number[] {
  const n = nums.length
  let j = 1

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
    if (nums[i] & 1) {
      while (nums[j] & 1)
        j += 2
      ;[nums[i], nums[j]] = [nums[j], nums[i]]
    }
  }

  return nums
}
```
