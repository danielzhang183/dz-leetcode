## Problem

Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

## Usage

### Example 1
```md
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```
### Example 2
```md
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>s</code> consists of only lowercase English letters.
- <code>1 &lt;= k &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>


## Solution

```ts
function reverseStr(s: string, k: number): string {

};
```
