## Problem

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a> with O(1) extra memory.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>s[i]</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters" target="_blank">printable ascii character</a>.

## Solution

```ts
/**
 Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
 */
function reverseString(s: string[]): void {

}
```
