## Problem

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get `long pressed`, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: name = 'alex', typed = 'aaleex'
Output: true
Explanation:'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: name = 'saeed', typed = 'ssaaedd'
Output: false
Explanation:'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= name.length, typed.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>name</code> and <code>typed</code> consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```ts
function isLongPressedName(name: string, typed: string): boolean {

}
```
