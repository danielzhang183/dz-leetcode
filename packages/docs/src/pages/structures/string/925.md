## Problem

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get `long pressed`, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: name = 'alex', typed = 'aaleex'
Output: true
Explanation:'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: name = 'saeed', typed = 'ssaaedd'
Output: false
Explanation:'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= name.length, typed.length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>name</code> and <code>typed</code> consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

### Two Pointers

backward traversal

```ts
function isLongPressedName(name: string, typed: string): boolean {
  let i = name.length - 1
  let j = typed.length - 1
  let repeat = name[i]
  while (1) {
    if (name[i] !== typed[j]) {
      while (typed[j] === repeat)
        j--
    }
    if (i < 0 || j < 0)
      break
    if (name[i] !== typed[j])
      return false
    repeat = typed[j]
    i--
    j--
  }

  return i === -1 && j === -1
}
```

forward traversal

```ts
function isLongPressedName(name: string, typed: string): boolean {
  let i = 0
  let j = 0
  while (i < name.length && j < typed.length) {
    if (name[i] === typed[j]) {
      i++
      j++
    }
    else if (i > 0 && typed[j] === name[i - 1]) {
      j++
    }
    else {
      break
    }
  }

  return i === name.length && j === typed.length
}
```
