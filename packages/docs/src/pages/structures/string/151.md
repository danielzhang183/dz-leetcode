## Problem

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return `a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.`

<b>Note</b> that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 ## Usage

### Example 1

```
**Input:** s = &quot;the sky is blue&quot;
**Output:** &quot;blue is sky the&quot;
```

### Example 2

```
**Input:** s = &quot;  hello world  &quot;
**Output:** &quot;world hello&quot;
**Explanation:** Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

### Example 3

```
**Input:** s = &quot;a good   example&quot;
**Output:** &quot;example good a&quot;
**Explanation:** You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

 
**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>s</code> contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces <code>&#39; &#39;</code>.
- There is **at least one** word in <code>s</code>.

 
<b data-stringify-type="bold">Follow-up: </b>If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it <b data-stringify-type="bold">in-place</b> with <code data-stringify-type="code">O(1) extra space?


## Solution

```ts
function reverseWords(s: string): string {

};
```
