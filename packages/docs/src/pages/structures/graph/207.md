## Problem

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>] indicates that you **must** take course b<sub>i</sub> first if you want to take course a<sub>i</sub>.

- For example, the pair <code>[0, 1]</code>, indicates that to take course <code>0</code> you have to first take course <code>1</code>.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 &lt;= numCourses &lt;= 2000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= prerequisites.length &lt;= 5000</code>
- <code>prerequisites[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> &lt; numCourses</code>
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.


## Solution

```ts
function canFinish(numCourses: number, prerequisites: number[][]): boolean {

}
```
