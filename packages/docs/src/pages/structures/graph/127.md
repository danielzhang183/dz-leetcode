## Problem

A **transformation sequence** from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s<sub>1</sub> -> s<sub>2</sub> -> ... -> s<sub>k</sub> such that:

- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every `s<sub>i</sub>` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- `s<sub>k</sub> == endWord`

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return `the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from` beginWord `to` endWord`, or`0`if no such sequence exists.`

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: beginWord = 'hit', endWord = 'cog', wordList = ['hot','dot','dog','lot','log','cog']
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is 'hit' -> 'hot' -> 'dot' -> 'dog' -> cog', which is 5 words long.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: beginWord = 'hit', endWord = 'cog', wordList = ['hot','dot','dog','lot','log']
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord 'cog' is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.

## Solution

```ts
function ladderLength(beginWord: string, endWord: string, wordList: string[]): number {

}
```
