<SubNav module="structures" />

Each edge shows a connection between a pair of nodes.

This data structure helps solve many real-life problems. Based on the orientation of the edges and the nodes there are various types of graphs.

*Here are some must to know concepts of graphs:*

* [Types of graphs]() – There are different types of graphs based on connectivity or weights of nodes.
* [Introduction to BFS and DFS]() – These are the algorithms for traversing through a graph
* [Cycles in a graph]() – Cycles are a series of connections following which we will be moving in a loop.
