## Problem

There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true `if you can visit **all** the rooms, or` false `otherwise`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>n == rooms.length</code>
- <code>2 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= rooms[i].length &lt;= 1000</code>
- <code>1 &lt;= sum(rooms[i].length) &lt;= 3000</code>
- <code>0 &lt;= rooms[i][j] &lt; n</code>
- All the values of <code>rooms[i]</code> are **unique**.

## Solution

```ts
function canVisitAllRooms(rooms: number[][]): boolean {

};
```
