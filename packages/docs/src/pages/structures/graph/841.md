## Problem

There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of **distinct keys** in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true `if you can visit **all** the rooms, or` false `otherwise`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```md
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
```

### Example 2

```md
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == rooms.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`
- `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n`
- All the values of `rooms[i]` are **unique**.

## Solution

### DFS

```ts
function canVisitAllRooms(rooms: number[][]): boolean {
  const seen: boolean[] = new Array(rooms.length).fill(false)
  const dfs = (room: number) => {
    if (seen[room])
      return
    seen[room] = true
    for (const key of rooms[room])
      dfs(key)
  }

  dfs(0)
  return seen.every(Boolean)
}
```

### BFS

```ts
function canVisitAllRooms(rooms: number[][]): boolean {
  const stack: number[][] = [rooms[0]]
  const seen: boolean[] = new Array(rooms.length).fill(false)
  seen[0] = true

  while (stack.length) {
    for (const key of stack.pop()!) {
      if (!seen[key]) {
        seen[key] = true
        stack.push(rooms[key])
      }
    }
  }

  return seen.every(Boolean)
}
```
